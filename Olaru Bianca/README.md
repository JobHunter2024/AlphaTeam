For Lab 4: 
Implemented skeleton classess and used 3 design patterns so far:
TaskFactory uses a combination of the factory and command paterns and TaskProcessor uses the facade pattern;

Used CHATGPT for help setting up Spring in my project and to double check if I need any other classes I might have missed, but it was difficult to get it to understand the full scope of the project and how components communicate.

Lab 5: Created 2 unit test classes for the queue and processor components; screenshots can be found in the UnitTest folder.
Created BPMN model of task manager in the BPMN folder.

Lab 6: Implemented main components of the project and added an aspect to handle logging functionality.
