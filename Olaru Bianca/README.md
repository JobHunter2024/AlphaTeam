For Lab 4: 
Implemented skeleton classess and used 3 design patterns so far:
TaskFactory uses a combination of the factory and command paterns and TaskProcessor uses the facade pattern;

Used CHATGPT for help setting up Spring in my project and to double check if I need any other classes I might have missed, but it was difficult to get it to understand the full scope of the project and how components communicate.
